Hey there — I’m Harshitha Chowdary 👩‍💻
Data Engineer by day, AI tinkerer by night.

I build data systems that don’t break at 2AM — scalable pipelines, real-time fraud detection, and audit-proof data models across AWS, Azure, Snowflake, and more. Whether it's taming messy JSON, tuning Spark jobs, or translating lyrics into GPT-powered stories, I’m always chasing clean logic and meaningful outcomes.

🔧 Things I love working on:
→ Building production-grade ETL/ELT pipelines that just work
→ Designing data lakes & warehouses that support ML & analytics
→ Shipping cool AI projects with GPT-4, LangChain, and Streamlit
→ Creating interactive dashboards with Tableau & D3.js
→ Teaching systems to speak data (and sometimes... sing it 🎶)

🔍 Currently exploring:
💡 GenAI for storytelling & music
⚙️ Real-time CDC + observability stacks
🌐 Data mesh principles at scale

Let’s connect, collaborate, or build something fun with real-world impact.
