# 👋 Hey there, I'm Harshitha Chowdary

I’m a Data Engineer with 4+ years of experience building scalable, production-ready data platforms across AWS and Azure.  
I like solving real-world problems with data — whether it’s automating a flaky pipeline, visualizing course demand, or making AI tell stories.

I care deeply about building systems that are **reliable, cost-aware, and actually used** by the people who need them.  
And when I’m not wrangling schemas or writing PySpark, I’m probably experimenting with LLMs, emotion-driven storytelling, or figuring out how to make dashboards feel less like reports and more like conversations.

## ⚙️ Tech I Work With

**Languages** → Python, SQL, PySpark, Bash  
**Cloud** → AWS (Glue, Redshift, Lambda, Kinesis, S3), Azure (ADF, Databricks, Synapse)  
**Data Infra** → Airflow, EMR, Delta Lake, Snowflake, Informatica  
**AI/LLMs** → GPT-4, Hugging Face, LangChain, ElevenLabs, FAISS  
**Dashboards** → Tableau, Power BI, Amazon QuickSight, D3.js  
**DevOps & Infra** → GitHub Actions, Terraform, Jenkins, CloudFormation

## 🚀 What I’ve Built

### 🎵 AI Song Storyteller  
**GPT-4, Hugging Face, ElevenLabs, D3.js**  
Turns lyrics into emotional story summaries, generates illustrations using Stable Diffusion, and narrates them using text-to-speech — in English, Telugu, Tamil, and Spanish.

### 📄 Resume Analyzer & Job Matcher  
**LangChain, FAISS, OpenAI, Streamlit**  
A smart app that reviews resumes, finds aligned job descriptions, and gives real-time feedback on keyword match and resume quality.

### 🔍 Real-Time Fraud Detection Pipeline  
**AWS Glue, Kinesis, PySpark, Redshift**  
Ingests 10M+ transactions/day and flags anomalies in near real-time. Reduced fraud detection lag by 70% with integrated alerting and lineage tracking.

### 🏫 Course Scheduling Dashboard  
**SQL, Tableau, Snowflake, Excel**  
Analyzed 10+ semesters of academic data to improve room allocation, reduce scheduling conflicts by 100%, and optimize class capacity across 500+ courses.

### 📚 Sentiment Trends in Historical Literature  
**Hive, NLP, Hadoop, Step Functions**  
Explored decade-wise emotional tone across 15+ literary datasets using MapReduce and NLP scoring — like literary analysis, but distributed.

## 💼 Experience Snapshot

- **ADP** → Designed and scaled ETL + CDC pipelines for 150M+ payroll/tax records/month using Databricks, Synapse, and Azure ADF  
- **Edvensoft** → Built real-time Kinesis pipelines, fraud alert systems, and secure S3-based data lakes with Redshift and EMR  
- Worked closely with finance, compliance, and product teams to deliver **secure, audit-ready, self-serve data platforms**

## 💡 Right now, I’m exploring...

- Data mesh patterns and domain-specific ingestion templates  
- Making LLMs more context-aware (and less forgetful)  
- Generative audio + visual storytelling using AI  
- CI/CD for data workflows that *don’t break on Fridays*
