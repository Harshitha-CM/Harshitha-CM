# 👋 Hey, I’m Harshitha Chowdary

I turn raw data into clean insights, flaky pipelines into reliable systems, and weird ideas into working AI apps.

🔧 **By profession**: I'm a Data Engineer with 4+ years of experience building secure, scalable, and production-grade data platforms across AWS and Azure. My toolbox includes Glue, Redshift, Lambda, Spark, Databricks, and a lot of SQL I’ve probably rewritten five times to shave off 10 seconds.

🤖 **By passion**: I love building with LLMs and generative AI—whether it's summarizing songs into stories, creating resume-analyzing bots, or giving data pipelines a personality (yes, with logs that talk back). I like projects that mix structure with chaos. Data meets art.

## 🛠️ What I Build:
- Pipelines that survive schema changes and timezone bugs  
- Real-time dashboards that actually refresh when it matters  
- GPT-powered tools that tell stories, classify emotions, or match jobs  
- Redshift queries that don’t make your BI team cry  
- Data systems that pass audits without a 2-week scramble

---

## 🧠 What I Work With:
**Languages**: Python, SQL, PySpark, Bash  
**Cloud**: AWS (Glue, Redshift, S3, Lambda), Azure (ADF, Databricks, Synapse)  
**AI/ML**: GPT-4, Hugging Face, LangChain, scikit-learn  
**Tools**: Airflow, Terraform, Snowflake, Tableau, QuickSight, GitHub Actions

## 💡 Currently Exploring:
- Data mesh patterns & domain-driven design  
- LLM-powered chatbots that summarize boring PDFs  
- Multilingual storytelling with AI  
- Cost-aware data engineering (because cloud bills are real)

📫 Let’s connect. Whether it's pipelines, prompts, or weird analytics ideas — I’m always down to build something cool, useful, and maybe a little unexpected.
