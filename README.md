# 👋 Hi, I’m Harshitha

I’m a curious builder who loves turning messy data into something useful — and turning useful data into something beautiful (or weird, if it works).  
Passionate about **data**, obsessed with **AI**, and always chasing that “oh wow, it actually works” moment.

---

## 🧠 Things I’m into:
- Writing pipelines that don’t crash at 2 AM  
- Getting GPT-4 to do something mildly absurd (or occasionally brilliant)  
- Making dashboards that feel more like stories than spreadsheets  
- Fixing broken data so no one else has to lose their mind  
- Teaching machines to make decisions... and also to vibe a little 🎶

---

## 💼 A little about what I do:
🛠️ **Data Engineer** with 4+ years of experience working across large-scale production systems at companies like **ADP** and **Edvensoft Solutions**.  
I work with batch + streaming data, secure data lakes, low-latency fraud detection pipelines, and AI-powered apps that plug right into the modern data stack.

I've owned ETL pipelines moving **150M+ records/month**, designed **audit-ready Redshift/Snowflake models**, built **AI storytelling apps**, and deployed infrastructure using **Terraform, DevOps, and Airflow**.

## 🧰 Tech Stack I Use:

**Languages**: Python, SQL, Bash, PySpark  
**Cloud Platforms**: AWS (Glue, Redshift, Lambda, Kinesis, S3), Azure (ADF, Databricks, Synapse)  
**Pipeline Tools**: Airflow, dbt, Terraform, Jenkins, CloudFormation  
**AI/ML**: GPT-4, Hugging Face, LangChain, Scikit-learn, ElevenLabs  
**Data & BI**: Snowflake, Redshift, Power BI, Tableau, QuickSight, Delta Lake  
**Other Fun Stuff**: D3.js, Stable Diffusion, MongoDB, REST APIs, Feature Engineering

## 🚀 Projects I’ve Had Fun Building:

### 🎵 **AI-Powered Song Storyteller**
*LLMs, GPT-4, ElevenLabs, Hugging Face, D3.js*  
Summarizes multilingual songs into short narratives and narrates them using TTS. Visualizes emotional arcs and themes with dynamic charts.

### 📄 **AI Resume Analyzer & Job Matcher**  
*Python, LangChain, OpenAI, FAISS, Streamlit*  
Built a tool that gives honest feedback on resume-job fit using LLMs, semantic search, and real-time prompt workflows.

### 📊 **Course Scheduling Dashboard**  
*SQL, Tableau, Excel, Snowflake*  
Created a visual tool that helped reduce classroom scheduling conflicts by 100% and improve room utilization by 30% using data from 10+ semesters.

### 🔍 **Real-Time Fraud Detection Pipeline**  
*AWS Glue, Kinesis, PySpark, Redshift, CloudWatch*  
Designed a production pipeline to ingest and process 10M+ transactions daily, enabling near real-time fraud flagging with 70% latency reduction.
